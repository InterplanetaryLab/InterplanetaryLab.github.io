The Deployable Optical Receiver Array (DORA) is a 3U testbed for future communications and radio astronomy technology. It includes a pathfinder for widefield
optical laser receivers  and a low frequency radio spectrometer which aims
to find the last radio quiet areas on earth in the meter wavelength bands.

The DORA project is a partnership between ASU's Low Frequency Cosmology lab who led the mission and the Interplanetary
Lab who built and operated the spacecraft. See the [LoCo DORA page](https://loco.lab.asu.edu/research/dora/)
