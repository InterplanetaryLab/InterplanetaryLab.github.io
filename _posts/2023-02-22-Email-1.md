Hello All, 

Happy New Year and we hope the first day of classes went well! We wanted to share a few updates about the Interplanetary Lab on campus.

We will continue to have our regular hours at Sun Devil Hall (see map for more instructions to the lab). 
Lab Open:  10 am to 5 pm  M-F
Dev Hours: Wednesday 4:30pm - 6pm.  (Workshops beginning at 4:30).

This semester, we will be hosting Dev Hours on Wednesday nights with a variety of personal development and engineering workshops. Our first talk will be this Wednesday by Chandler Hutchens and Christopher McCormick, where they will introduce you to the lab and what we do here followed by a tour!

Here are the highlights for Fall 2022 in case you missed it!
