Welcome to the Interplanetary Initiative Lab Wiki. This wiki contains technical information pertaining to the lab. 

The IILab is a cross between a university training cubesat lab, a maker space, and an R&D laboratory. The 6000 sq ft facility includes collaboration space, electronics development, fabrication, assembly and test.  Test facilities include a cubesat shaker table, a thermal vacuum chamber, a small clean room, a roof deck, and air-bearing attitude test.  Some of these facilities are operational now, others are under development.  To get involved as a student, ASU faculty, or commercial partner see our [web site](interplanetary.asu.edu/Lab).
