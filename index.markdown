Welcome to Arizona State University's Interplanetary Lab (IPL).


# About
IPL supplies training and mission technical services to the University and its partners. As a training lab it is a maker-space style environment open to students and partners. As a service provider the lab is primarily powered by trained student staff working under the direction of faculty.

 The 6000 sq ft facility includes collaboration space, electronics development, fabrication, assembly and test.  Test facilities include a cubesat shaker table, a thermal vacuum chamber, a small clean room, a roof deck, and anechoic chamber.

An Staff member must be present during ordinary USER use of the lab. The lab is open when staff are present, see the staff [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=Y19zcWNpdXFhb2RxM3Q1aGU1MHIxNzc3Zm9wa0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
