Welcome to the Interplanetary Initiative Lab Wiki. This wiki contains technical information pertaining to the lab. 

The IILab is a cross between a university training cubesat lab, a maker space, and an R&D laboratory. The 6000 sq ft facility includes collaboration space, electronics development, fabrication, assembly and test.  Test facilities include a cubesat shaker table, a thermal vacuum chamber, a small clean room, a roof deck, and air-bearing attitude test.  Some of these facilities are operational now, others are under development.

An II-Lifeguard must be present during ordinary student use of the lab. The lab is open when a lifeguard is present, see the lifeguard [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=Y19zcWNpdXFhb2RxM3Q1aGU1MHIxNzc3Zm9wa0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
